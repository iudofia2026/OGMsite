# OGM ABOUT

## Our Story

OGM was created with a clear point of view: how you drink matters.

I've always gravitated toward tequila that can be sipped thoughtfully or mixed with care - never rushed, never masked, and never paired with anything that takes away from its character. That belief shaped every decision behind OGM.

The idea originally grew from a desire to create a more intentional cocktail experience — one rooted in real ingredients and honest craftsmanship. As that vision evolved, it became clear that everything begins with the spirit itself.

So we started where flavor and character truly develop:

**Reposado.**

OGM Reposado is crafted to highlight balance, smoothness, and depth - rested just long enough to develop complexity while keeping the agave front and center. It's designed to be enjoyed neat, over ice, or as the foundation for a well-made margarita made with quality ingredients.

OGM isn't about excess or shortcuts. It's about choosing better:
- better ingredients
- better moments
- better ways to enjoy them

The margarita that inspired this journey is still part of the story and will return in a form that reflects the same standards and intention.
